Chinese Global Community

Chinese Global Community (CGC) is a student organization founded and operated by Chinese international students around the world. We strive to serve the students here at UCSD with the purpose of learning the Chinese culture, embracing the diverse background of the student community, and enhancing students' college life experience. With our cultural, lifestyle, and academic services, CGC hopes to bring an authentic Chinese experience to everyone through activities such as festivals, exhibitions, and programs.
